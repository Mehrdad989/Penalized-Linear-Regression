# Penalized-Linear-Regression
## The wine taste data set comes from the UC Irvine data repository 
(http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality).1
 The data set 
contains chemical analyses for 1,599 wines along with average taste scores 
given to each wine by a panel of wine tasters. The predictive problem is 
to predict the taste given the data on chemical composition. The chemical 
composition data consist of numeric measurements of 11 different chemical 
propertiesâ€”alcohol content, pH and citric acid, and so on.
